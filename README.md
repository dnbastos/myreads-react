The purpose of this project is to demonstrate understanding of the basic structure and operation of a React-based app. This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.

## Instructions

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* With the server running, you can view in the browser: `http://localhost:3000`

## Important

The backend API is limited to a fixed set of search terms. See below for valid search options, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
